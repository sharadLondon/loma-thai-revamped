      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        Thai cuisine is flavoured with fresh herbs and spices that do more than taste good — they support digestion, reduce inflammation and provide antioxidants.
        Here’s a short, practical guide to the most common Thai herbs you’ll see on a menu and why they matter for health.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: 22 }}>Lemongrass — Calming & Digestive</h2>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        Used in soups and curries, lemongrass contains natural oils that can help soothe the stomach, reduce bloating and offer mild antimicrobial properties.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: 18 }}>Galangal — Anti-inflammatory & Warming</h2>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        Galangal (similar to ginger) is a staple in Thai broths like Tom Yum. It’s traditionally used to help digestion, reduce inflammation and support immune response.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: 18 }}>Kaffir Lime Leaves — Fragrant & Antioxidant</h2>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        These aromatic leaves add citrus notes to curries and soups and contain antioxidants which support overall cellular health.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: 18 }}>Thai Basil — Antimicrobial & Nutrient-Rich</h2>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        Thai basil brings bright flavour and also contains compounds that may help with mild digestive issues and contain vitamins that support general wellbeing.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>Practical Tip</h3>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        When possible, choose dishes that use fresh herbs (not heavily processed sauces) — this preserves natural oils and active compounds. Examples: soups, herb-forward salads, and curries finished with fresh basil or lime.
