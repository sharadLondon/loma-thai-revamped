        Fresh Thai herbs are the heart of Thai cooking — bright, aromatic, and impossible to fully replace with dried
        versions. The good news? You can grow many of them in the UK, even with unpredictable weather.

      <h2>🍃 Thai Basil</h2>
      <p>Grows well indoors near sunlight. Water regularly and harvest often to keep it bushy and flavourful.</p>

      <h2>🍃 Lemongrass</h2>
      <p>Start lemongrass from supermarket stalks. Root them in water, then plant in a warm spot.</p>

      <h2>🍃 Kaffir Lime Leaves</h2>
      <p>A dwarf kaffir lime tree grows beautifully indoors. Essential fragrance for curries and soups.</p>

      <h2>🍃 Coriander</h2>
      <p>Plant coriander often because it bolts quickly. Perfect fresh for salads and garnishes.</p>

      <h2>🌱 Tips for Growing Thai Herbs Indoors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use pots with drainage holes</li>
        <li>Give herbs indirect light</li>

        <li>Harvest small amounts often</li>
      </ul>
