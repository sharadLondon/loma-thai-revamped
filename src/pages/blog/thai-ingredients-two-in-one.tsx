        Thai cooking hits differently — not just because it tastes amazing but
        because the ingredients do double duty. Here are the top 5 Thai flavour
        bombs that also make your body happy.

      <h2>1. Lemongrass</h2>
      <p>Bright, citrusy, fresh. Helps digestion + calms the stomach.</p>

      <h2>2. Kaffir Lime Leaf</h2>
      <p>That iconic Thai aroma. Great for mood + stress relief.</p>

      <h2>3. Thai Basil</h2>
      <p>Peppery and sweet. Anti-inflammatory + boosts focus.</p>

      <h2>4. Galangal</h2>
      <p>Warm, sharp, ginger-but-fancier. Supports immunity.</p>

      <h2>5. Bird’s Eye Chilli</h2>
      <p>Heat that makes you feel alive. Boosts metabolism + endorphins.</p>

      <h2>✨ The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        Thai food tastes incredible because these ingredients are naturally
        powerful. At Loma Thai, we use them the way they’re meant to be used —
