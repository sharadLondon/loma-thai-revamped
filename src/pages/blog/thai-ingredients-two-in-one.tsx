        Thai cuisine is built on balance — salty, spicy, sour, sweet, and umami. Here are 5 must-have ingredients that
        do the heavy lifting in most Thai dishes.
      </p>

      <h2>🌶️ 1. Fish Sauce</h2>
      <p>The salty backbone of Thai flavour. Add to curries, stir-fries, soups, dips — everything.</p>

      <h2>🥥 2. Coconut Milk</h2>
      <p>Rich, creamy, and perfect for curries like green, red, and Panang. Use full-fat for the best flavour.</p>

      <h2>🍋 3. Kaffir Lime Leaves</h2>
      <p>Irreplaceable fragrance. Add whole leaves to soups and curries, then remove before serving.</p>

      <h2>🌿 4. Thai Basil</h2>
      <p>Peppery, slightly sweet, and essential for dishes like Pad Krapow and Green Curry.</p>

      <h2>🔥 5. Chillies</h2>
      <p>Bird’s eye chillies bring the heat. Use sparingly — or generously if you dare!</p>

      <p>Master these five ingredients, and you’ll unlock 80% of Thai cooking at home.</p>
