      <h1>A Beginner’s Guide to Thai Spice Levels</h1>

      <p>
        If you’re new to Thai food, the spice levels can feel confusing. What
        counts as mild? What is considered “Thai spicy”? This guide breaks down
        the different heat levels so you can confidently choose the right dish —
        whether you love gentle flavours or fiery heat.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Mild Thai Dishes — Full Flavour, No Heat</h2>
      <p>
        Mild dishes include coconut-based curries, stir-fries without chilli,
        and noodle dishes like Pad Thai. They offer rich flavour without the
        burn — ideal for beginners.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Medium Spice — A Gentle Kick</h2>
      <p>
        Medium spice dishes include small amounts of chilli, offering warmth
        without overwhelming heat. Great for diners exploring Thai flavours.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Hot — Classic Thai Heat</h2>
      <p>
        Hot dishes contain fresh chillies and offer intense heat balanced with
        deep flavours. This is the typical level many locals enjoy.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Thai-Spicy — For the Brave</h2>
      <p>
        “Thai spicy” is significantly hotter than what many Western palates are
        used to. It’s bold, fiery, and best suited for those who enjoy powerful
        chilli intensity.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Tips for Controlling Heat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for less spice if unsure</li>
        <li>Drink milk, not water, to reduce chilli burn</li>
        <li>Choose coconut-based dishes for softer heat</li>
        <li>Start mild and work upward</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Thai food offers delicious choices at every spice level. Understanding
        the heat scale helps make every meal enjoyable — from mild to Thai
        spicy.
